# PointCloudARDouble
AR Application using ARCore to render colored Point Clouds in augmented reality. Used for double stimulus point cloud experiments. 
It is able to show colored point clouds of up to 600000 points in size. First they are loaded into the memory using the "allData.txt"
file. Then the order is determined with the corresponding "batchX.file". Here it is important that each line contains the two contents
to be visualized. 
Location data is saved after each pair, the scores at the end. 

Introduction:
As virtual reality and augmented reality are becoming increasingly common, and as new improvements are being released to make it 
more accurate and engaging, point clouds are becoming increasingly relevant. 
With the Kinect and other devices like it, it is becoming easier to capture point cloud data to construct 3D objects. 
They are used to help certain 3D polygon-rendering algorithms to quickly update. 
They are quickly becoming a viable alternative for 3D applications such as augmented reality, virtual 
reality and other 3D-visualization processes. 
Having metrics to evaluate the quality of point clouds is paramount to advance further in the field. 
There is a lack of research in this field as it is quite new. 
Having the tools to perform experiments in this domain would greatly improve the understanding when it 
comes to point clouds visualization.
